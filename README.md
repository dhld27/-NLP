# Review Sentiment Analysis - Genshin Impact

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of user reviews related to the popular game **Genshin Impact**. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, the model classifies reviews into different sentiment categories (e.g., Positive, Neutral, Negative). The project leverages **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques to gain insights into player feedback.

## Dataset
- **Source**: User reviews from online platforms such as Google Play Store, App Store, or game forums.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
- **Labeling**: Sentiment labels are categorized as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - **NLP**: NLTK
  - **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
  - **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras 
  - **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Modeling Approaches**:
  - CountVectorizer
  - LSTM-based sentiment classifier

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Scrape or gather user reviews.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare text for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize word frequencies, sentiment distribution, etc.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Convert text into numerical representations (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, etc.).
5. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Train multiple models and evaluate their performance.
6. **Results & Insights**: Analyze model performance and derive insights from user reviews.
7. **Deployment** (Optional): Deploy the model as an API or web application.

## Results
- Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- Insights into common topics in positive and negative reviews.
- Comparison between different models and their effectiveness in sentiment classification.

## Future Work
- Improve model accuracy using advanced deep learning techniques.
- Implement aspect-based sentiment analysis to understand user concerns in detail.
- Deploy a real-time sentiment analysis tool for Genshin Impact reviews.
